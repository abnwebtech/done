**done** is a task management app that lets you set a timer for each task and organize tasks in any order.

Your task list is saved automatically in your browser, so it's always there when you need it. You can also save it to the cloud with any username and password.

##Details

**done** is built using Twitter Flight, localStorage, and the OpenKeyVal persistence service. There is no backend, everything is served out of Github Pages.

##Windows features

**done** supports both Snap mode in Windows 8 and Pinned Sites in IE9+. This way, users can see the task list while they're working, and open **done** instantly from the task bar.
